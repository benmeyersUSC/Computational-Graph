# Computational-Graph
A small implementation of computational graphs akin to those in ML libraries. I am not rewriting PyTorch, but want to get my hands on the abstract power of the computational graph. 



# Notes
- Re-learning these activation derivatives is supremely satisfying especially because we can just solve them and pack them away, abstracted, into our toolkit of nodes on the graph. Owning understanding is the only way.
- So incredibly satisfying to compose something so useful out of abstracted pieces.
